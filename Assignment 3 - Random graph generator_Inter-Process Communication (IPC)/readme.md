Here I have generated a random input of vertices and edges that would be provided as input to the Vertex cover problem. Also, I have written a driver program in C++ that uses Inter-Process Communication (IPC) to link the output of the random input generator to the input of the Vertex cover problem (Python script), and the output of the
Vertext cover problem(Python script) to the input of the Shortest path script(C++ program).
